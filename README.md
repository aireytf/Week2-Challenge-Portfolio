# Week 2 Challenge Portfolio

## Description

This repository serves to showcase my work in completing the Module 2 Challenge of my edX Bootcamp. 

The challenge was to create a site to host my portfolio as a web developer, that will eventually be used to showcase my skills and talents to potential employers. 

As per the following screenshots, I was provided with a Demo for a portfolio with an example of the appropriate appearance and functionality for the application. I made adapatations from this to make my own portfolio individual to me:

The required features of the site were as follows:
- When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about myself, my work, and how to contact me.
- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications.
- When presented with the first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to the viewport.

I succeeded in all but the last feature, as I ran out of time to include full and appropriate media qualites to make my site responsive on various screen sizes and devices.

I have, also, included a CV section in my header (though this was beyond the minimum required features for this challenge. I will include a link to my CV, as I update this portfolio overtime.
