# Week2-Challenge-Portfolio

## Description

This repository serves to showcase my work in completing the Module 2 Challenge of my edX Bootcamp. 

The challenge was to create a site to host my portfolio as a web developer. 

As per the following screenshots, I was provided with a Demo for a portfolio with an example of the appropriate appearance and functionality for the application. I made adapatations from this to make my own portfolio individual to me:

The required features of the site were as follows:
When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.

I succeeded in all but the last feature, as I ran out of time to include full and appropriate media qualites to make my site responsive on various screen sizes and devices.
